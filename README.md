This is a project that i did with the guidance of my course on udemy. I did not design any of the frontend portions, i only worked on the backend API and Server documents. This blog website has much more functionality than my first.
1) download the project files
2) open a new gitbash terminal and cd into the project folder
3) run npm init -y (if needed), then npm i
4) run the command nodemon server.js
5) the server is now active on localhost:3000
6) next, open a new terminal, cd into the project folder, and type nodemon index.js
7) now, the API is active on localhost:4000 and is communicating with our server
8) open localhost:3000 in your browser and use the website
